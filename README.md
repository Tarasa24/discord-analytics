# Discord Analytics!

Have you ever wanted to see who is the top chatter in your favourite Discord server? Or have you ever wondered, what are the most active hours? Or are you simply just a data-lover? *(ehm.. fetishist)*
Then look no more! **Discord Analytics** is here for you to help.

## We need your help!

Python parser is really light weight and considerably fast (500 000 messages in around 24 seconds), thes craping itself takes several times longer. Thes where **YOU** comes to the play!

 - Go to [THIS](https://dht.chylex.com/) website
 - Follow written steps
 - Scrape server of your choice
 - Anonymizate your scraped data with our python script
 - And create Pull request with your generated .json file

Alternatively just put whole file to https://pastebin.com/ and send it directly to me on Discord: **Tarasa24#1761**

## Now on more serious note
The concept itself is fairly simple. 
We are using [generated scrape](https://dht.chylex.com/), that is then parsed and anonymizated with our python script. And it is finally all represented with the help of [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) library.

This project should really act like showing of interesting concept, rather than in-real-world-used web application. So please, bear that in mind.

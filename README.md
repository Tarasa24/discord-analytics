## Technologies
Project is created with:
* <a href="https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js" target="_blank">chart.js</a>
* <a href="https://dht.chylex.com/" target="_blank">Discord History Tracker</a>
* <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>


## Requirements and Setup
Using *Discord History Tracker*, scrape server of your choice and final .txt file put into ./py_parser/dht

When in doubt how to use mentioned tracker, head to the official website: <a href="https://dht.chylex.com/" target="_blank">dht.chylex.com</a>

## Execution
Simply run **execute.bat** when you want to parse ever single .txt file in /dht folder. It will open one cmd window per file parsed due the speed reasons. No need to be scared ðŸ‘Œ

___

Alternatively, if you want to parse .txt files individually, use file path as an argument:
```
 $ cd ./discord-analytics/py_parser
 $ python app.py "<path to the file>"
```

This project should more or less act as proof of concept, rather than real-world web application.

## Requirements and Setup

#### General
1. Python (for parser)
2. Node.js (for webserver)
3. Discord bot (for backend)
___
#### DHT
Using *Discord History Tracker*, scrape server of your choice and put the generated file inside `py_parser/dht` folder.

When in doubt how to use mentioned tracker, head to the official website: <a href="https://dht.chylex.com/" target="_blank">dht.chylex.com</a>
___
#### <a name="Webserver-setup">Webserver</a>
```
 $ cd webserver
 $ npm install
```
Inside `.env` specify your <a href="https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token" target="_blank">discord bot token</a> + frontend and backend port.
> Note that frontend and backend ports **must** be different

## Execution

#### Parser
Simply run **execute.bat** when you want to parse ever single .txt file in /dht folder. It will open one cmd window per file parsed due the speed reasons. No need to be scared ðŸ‘Œ

Alternatively, if you want to parse .txt files individually, use file path as an argument:
```
 $ cd py_parser
 $ python app.py "<path to the file>"
```
___
#### <a name="Webserver-execution">Webserver</a>
```
 $ cd webserver
 $ nf start
```
or
```
 $ cd webserver
 $ npm start
```

## Conclusion
This project has finally come to major rebuild. Now with optimalised parser, more  features and of course, not fogetting real-life webserver architecture that can be easily initegated with reverse shells like *nginx* etc..
